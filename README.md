# ElevateWorkshop

This project contains a simplified version of Adafruit's Accelerometer, Magnetometer and NeoPixel libraries. The aim is to use the simplified versions for easy coding exercizes for students.

This project depends on the following libraries:
 * Adafruit_Neopixel: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
 * Adafruit_Sensor: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor
 * Adafruit_LSM303DLHC: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LSM303DLHC
 
The Elevate directory is in the Arduino library format and can simply be imported into your Arduino sketch directory.
The SampleFloraCode is a simple Arduino sketch with all of the code in one file.
